			</h2>
			<p>Two days out. A section of the promenade deck. <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Mildred Douglas</b> and her aunt are discovered reclining in deck chairs. The former is a girl of twenty, slender, delicate, with a pale, pretty face marred by a self-conscious expression of disdainful superiority. She looks fretful, nervous and discontented, bored by her own anemia. Her aunt is a pompous and proud⁠—and fat⁠—old lady. She is a type even to the point of a double chin and lorgnettes. She is dressed pretentiously, as if afraid her face alone would never indicate her position in life. <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Mildred</b> is dressed all in white.</p>
			<p>The impression to be conveyed by this scene is one of the beautiful, vivid life of the sea all about⁠—sunshine on the deck in a great flood, the fresh sea wind blowing across it. In the midst of this, these two incongruous, artificial figures, inert and disharmonious, the elder like a gray lump of dough touched up with rouge, the younger looking as if the vitality of her stock had been sapped before she was conceived, so that she is the expression not of its life energy but merely of the artificialities that energy had won for itself in the spending.</p>

Well, I hope Whitechapel will provide the needed nerve tonic. Do not ask me to chaperone you there, however. I told your father I would not. I loathe deformity.

I would like to be sincere, to touch life somewhere. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">With weary bitterness.</i> But I’m afraid I have neither the vitality nor integrity. All that was burnt out in our stock before I was born. Grandfather’s blast furnaces, flaming to the sky, melting steel, making millions⁠—then father keeping those home fires burning, making more millions⁠—and little me at the tail-end of it all. I’m a waste product in the Bessemer process⁠—like the millions. Or rather, I inherit the acquired trait of the byproduct, wealth, but none of the energy, none of the strength of the steel that made it.
